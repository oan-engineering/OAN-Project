# Put a Jenkins agent on the openg2p-Gen2 WireGuard VPN, so the dev deploy can
# reach the cluster.
#
# The dev cluster's API server — https://10.15.0.1:6443 in the gen2-kubeconfig
# credential, the same address rancher.openg2p.test resolves to — is routable
# only over the openg2p-Gen2 WireGuard VPN. An agent off the VPN builds and
# pushes the images, then fails the dev deploy with
#
#   Error: kubernetes cluster unreachable: Get "https://10.15.0.1:6443/version":
#   dial tcp 10.15.0.1:6443: i/o timeout
#
# Run this ONCE, as root, on the machine that runs the pipeline's builds — the
# Deploy to Dev stage runs on the same agent as the build. If Jenkins itself runs
# in a container, run it on the HOST: the container's traffic leaves through the
# host's routes.
#
# It needs a peer config issued for THIS agent by whoever administers the
# openg2p-Gen2 WireGuard server. Never reuse a person's peer config: two
# machines on one key keep stealing the peer's endpoint from each other, and
# both tunnels drop in turn.
#
# What it does:
#   1. installs wireguard-tools (apt-get, dnf or yum) when wg-quick is missing
#   2. writes /etc/wireguard/<iface>.conf (mode 0600) from the peer config, with
#      - AllowedIPs narrowed to the API server. The deploy talks to the API
#        server and nothing else on the dev network; the cluster pulls the
#        images from ECR itself. A peer config handed out for a person usually
#        routes the whole 10.15.0.0/16 — or everything, with 0.0.0.0/0, which
#        would send the agent's ECR pushes through the VPN too.
#      - the DNS line dropped. The kubeconfig names the server by IP, and
#        wg-quick hands DNS to resolvconf, which a bare agent often lacks — the
#        tunnel would fail to start over a setting nothing uses.
#      - PersistentKeepalive = 25 added when absent, so a NAT in front of the
#        agent keeps the tunnel's mapping alive between builds.
#   3. enables wg-quick@<iface>, so the tunnel comes back after a reboot
#   4. checks that the API server answers through it
#
# Usage:
#   sudo ./ci/setup-agent-vpn.sh <peer.conf> [options]
#
#   ./ci/setup-agent-vpn.sh jenkins-agent.conf --dry-run   # show what would be
#                                                          # written, keys hidden
# Options:
#   --allowed-ips CIDR[,CIDR]  routed through the tunnel (default 10.15.0.1/32)
#   --iface NAME               interface / config name (default openg2p-gen2)
#   --check HOST:PORT          must accept a connection once up (default 10.15.0.1:6443)
#   --dry-run                  print the config that would be written and stop
