"""Approval-pending-too-long email reminder.

Mirrors gen1's `g2p.livestock.registry._cron_send_approval_pending_reminders()`
(g2p_livestock_registry/models/livestock_registry.py) — emails the next
approver when a Livestock record has been sitting at the same
Kebele/Woreda/Zone/Region approval stage for too long (default 3 days)
without moving forward. Gen1 matched `res.users` group membership scoped to
the record's kebele/woreda/zone/region; gen2 has no equivalent
approver-directory, so recipients come from env config's district mapping
instead (the record's own kebele/woreda/zone/region — whichever matches the
stage that's stuck — is passed as the "district" key; see
reminder_alert_utils.resolve_recipients).

Plain, directly-callable functions for the same reason the other reminder
services are.
