    Overwrite, not fill-blank-only: on a reopened draft the operator may
    correct the Farmer ID / name in the Farmer section, and the Livestock row
    must follow or the engine scores the wrong farmer. That is safe because
    no section of the intake form edits these three fields on the Livestock

    Why: the deduplication engine scores only the main (Livestock) register —
    the Farmer section embedded in the Livestock intake form is never scored —
    and the Livestock dedup schema is farmer_id / fayda_fan_id / farmer_name /
    woreda. Until 2026-09-14 the intake form's "Farmer Details" section wrote
    those three fields onto the Livestock row; it was removed as redundant for
    the operator, after which the Livestock row carried only woreda at intake
    (score ~10 of a 55 threshold) and no duplicate was ever flagged until the
    identity was copied at approval. Doing that copy at intake restores the
    engine's input without bringing the section back.

    Called from post_intake_upsert of BOTH domain services, so the copy happens
    whichever section is saved first: the Farmer section (farmer row given,
    livestock rows looked up) or a Livestock-register section (livestock rows
    given, farmer row looked up). Runs inside the section-save transaction.
