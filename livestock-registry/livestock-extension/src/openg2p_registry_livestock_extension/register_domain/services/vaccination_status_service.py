"""Vaccination Status auto-flip: UP_TO_DATE -> OVERDUE once the animal's most
recent vaccination's next_due_date has passed.

Mirrors gen1's `g2p.livestock.vaccination._cron_flag_overdue_vaccinations()`
(g2p_livestock_registry/models/livestock_event.py). UP_TO_DATE is set the
moment a Vaccination is logged (see
g2p_register_domain_service_vaccination.py's post_approve/post_ingest); this
sweep is the other half — the daily check that notices time has passed the
due date and flips the animal's status forward. Unlike the email reminders
(vaccination_reminder_service.py), this changes the animal's own record, not
just a notification, so it needs no dedup/tracking table of its own — a
NOT-yet-OVERDUE animal past its due date is, by definition, something this
sweep should always correct, every run, until a fresh vaccination is logged
(post_approve/post_ingest resets it to UP_TO_DATE again).

Plain, engine-parameterized function for the same reason the other reminder
services are — callable from the scheduled celery-beat task
(vaccination_reminder_beat_producer.py, which already runs the vaccination
email reminders daily — this sweep piggybacks on that same task rather than
adding a whole new core-patch/schedule entry) and callable directly for a
same-day test.
