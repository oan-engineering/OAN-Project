"""Upcoming-birth (calving) email reminder.

Mirrors gen1's `g2p.livestock.breeding._cron_send_calving_reminders()`
(g2p_livestock_registry/models/livestock_event.py) — emails when a Breeding
record's `expected_calving_date` is coming up within the next 7 days, while
the pregnancy outcome is still PENDING (not yet confirmed as a birth or
marked failed), so the field officer can be ready to record the outcome.
Gen1 emailed whoever logged the breeding record (`create_uid`); gen2's
`created_by` on the register base is a plain display-name string (no
directory behind it to resolve an email from), so recipients come from env
config instead — see reminder_alert_utils.resolve_recipients.

Plain, directly-callable function for the same reason the other reminder
services are.
