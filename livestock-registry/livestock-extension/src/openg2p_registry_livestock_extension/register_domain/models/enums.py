"""Enumerations for values the livestock registry does NOT model as lookup tables.

Anything an administrator should be able to extend without a code change — species,
breed, vaccine, disease, approval status — is an **attribute lookup** instead: a plain
String column resolved against g2p_attributes / g2p_attribute_values and fed by the
master-data catalogue. What remains here are the closed value sets, taken verbatim from
the `fields.Selection` definitions in g2p_livestock_registry.
