-- G2R-134: Configure deduplication for the Livestock Registry.
--
-- The platform's deduplication engine compares every new intake submission /
-- change request against existing records using the per-register
-- `deduplicate_schema` (which fields, exact or fuzzy, and their weight) and
-- flags candidates whose weighted score reaches `dedup_threshold_score`.
-- It runs ONLY for registers with register_purpose = REGISTER (Farmer and
-- Livestock); child TABLE registers (Animal, events, ...) are never scored, so
-- their config is cleared here — duplicates there are blocked by the domain
-- services' validations instead (ear tag + species + breed, duplicate events).
--
-- The seed files (g2p_register_schemas.sql, g2p_register_definitions.sql) carry
-- the same values for a fresh database; this patch brings an EXISTING database
-- (local, staging, test) up to date. Safe to run more than once.

-- Livestock holding: "the same farmer registered a second holding".
-- farmer_id / fayda_fan_id are the two identifiers; farmer_name tolerates
-- spelling differences; woreda only supports. oan_id and registration_date are
-- dropped: oan_id is never populated by the form, and both only lowered the
-- score of genuine duplicates.

-- Farmer: "the same person registered twice", including with a typo in the
-- name or a differing farmer code. Fayda (national ID) is the strongest
-- signal, then the farmer code, then fuzzy first/last name. Only identity
-- fields that Gen1 also captured are used, so records migrated from Gen1
-- (which have no date_of_birth / mobile_number) score the same way as new
-- Gen2 records — an empty field would otherwise count in the denominator and
-- drag every migrated record's score down.
-- NOTE: the platform's intake dedup worker only scores sections whose
-- register_id equals the submission's own register (see
-- deduplication_intake_forms_vs_register_worker.py). The Farmer section
-- embedded in the Livestock intake form therefore is NOT scored; this config
-- takes effect for a Farmer intake form (register_id = Farmer) and for change
-- requests on Farmer records.
