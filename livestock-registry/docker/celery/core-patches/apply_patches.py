"""Applies patches to this image's installed openg2p_registry_celery_beat AND
openg2p_registry_celery_worker packages at build time (both live in the same
shared celery image — see docker/celery/Dockerfile):
  - audit-log retention — G2R-135's "7-year retention period" requirement.
  - notifiable-disease outbreak alert — 3+ cases of the same disease in the
    same district within 14 days -> alert email to vet officers.
  - vaccination due-soon / overdue reminder emails.
  - approval-pending-too-long reminder emails.
  - upcoming-birth (calving) reminder emails.
  - intake_form_register_ingest_worker: deterministic row processing order
    (was unordered) — see the patch below for why this matters.

Same technique as docker/staff-api/core-patches/apply_patches.py and the same
reason: celery-beat's task registry and beat_schedule are both hardcoded in
its own installed package, with no extension hook for a domain package to
add a scheduled task of its own — so this is a minimal, exact-match patch
rather than a wholesale file replacement, applied at every build so it
survives rebuilds instead of being silently lost.

Run at Docker build time only (see docker/celery/Dockerfile).

# ─── Fix: intake_form_register_ingest_worker processed a submission's intake
# rows in WHATEVER order Postgres happened to return them (no ORDER BY), not
# insertion order. Harmless for most sections, but a real bug for one like
# Health Event where post_ingest side effects (our health_status sync) are
# order-sensitive: a Disease row and a Recovery row added to the same
# submission could apply in either order, sometimes leaving the animal
# stuck SICK even though Recovery was the row added (chronologically) last.
# Ordering by created_at makes the same-submission processing order match
# the order the rows were actually added in — a general correctness fix,
# not specific to the livestock extension, so every section benefits.
