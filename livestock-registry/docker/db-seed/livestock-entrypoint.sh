# Livestock db-seed entrypoint: the platform's own seed first, then the real
# Ethiopia geo hierarchy into master_data.
#
# The platform image's /seed/entrypoint.sh loads this registry's metadata into
# the registry DB and, when LOAD_GEO_DATA=true, its own generic sample geo
# (country/region/district/ward/village, levels l0..l4) into master_data. This
# registry's Location section asks for level ids level-region / level-zone /
# level-woreda / level-kebele, so that generic set leaves the dropdowns EMPTY
# (seen on the dev cluster, 2026-09-17). Keep LOAD_GEO_DATA=false and let this
# step load the real hierarchy instead — the same file the local compose stack
# has always used (docker/db-seed/geo/ethiopia_geo_seed.sql.gz).
#
# Idempotent: the SQL uses ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING keyed on level_value_mnemonic,
# so the unique index it relies on is created first (IF NOT EXISTS). Needs the
# same MD_PG* variables the platform seed already receives (chart job and
# compose both set them); skipped with a notice when they are absent. A failure
# here is reported loudly but does not fail the job — the registry metadata
# loaded before it must stay in place.
#
# An environment that ever ran with LOAD_GEO_DATA=true (the dev cluster did)
# still holds the platform's sample geo, and the two sets cannot coexist: its
# level mnemonic "region" collides with ours (g2p_geo_levels.level_mnemonic is
# unique) and its village names repeat, which blocks the unique index above.
# That set is the platform's demo data (openg2p-data/geo/geo.csv: country >
# region > district > ward > village, level ids l0..l4); nothing in this
# registry references it and LOAD_GEO_DATA=false keeps it from coming back, so
# it is removed first — but only when it is exactly that set, level ids AND
# mnemonics, so real data under other ids is never touched.
#
# Second post-seed step: the AWE approver rules. The seed writes the four
# http rules with the local compose address (http://staff-api:8000) and the
# default secret. On a cluster AWE cannot reach that name, so the rules are
# rewritten here to this deployment's own staff-api base URL and secret:
#   APPROVER_RESOLVER_BASE_URL  — explicit base (scheme://host[:port]); else
#                                 derived from AWE_CALLBACK_CALLER_SERVICE when
#                                 that is a URL (same host serves the resolver
#                                 and the webhook); else http://staff-api:8000
#   APPROVER_RESOLVER_SECRET    — must equal staff-api's APPROVER_RESOLVER_SECRET
#                                 (default livestock-approver-resolver-secret)
# Runs only when the AWE seed ran (AWE_DB_SEED_ENABLED=true, AWE_PG* set) and
# is idempotent: same inputs, same rows.
